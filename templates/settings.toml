[timestamps]

# Prefer reading recording times from file modification timestamps instead of
# looking at the date and time on the filename. If the filename format is not
# recognised, timestamps are going to be used anyways. In this case the inferred
# satellite will be always NOAA 19 and you will have to indicate it otherwise.

# Supported filenames. Indicate where years, hours, etc. are located on the
# filename, used to detemine recording time and satellite received from
# filename. The program will compare the loaded WAV filename against each one of
# these formats until it finds a match, if no match is found, the time will be
# loaded from the file modification timestamp and the sat will be NOAA 19. If
# some date/time value is missing, the current will be used. E.g. if there is no
# month, the current month will be used.
#
# Supported variables:
# - %Y: Year as a 4 digit number.
# - %m: Month as a 2 digit number.
# - %d: Day as a 2 digit number.
# - %H: Hour as a 2 digit number.
# - %M: Minute as a 2 digit number.
# - %S: Second as a 2 digit number.
# - %N: Satellite number, should be 15, 18 or 19.
# - %!: Recording frequency in Hz, also used to determine satellite number
#   (noaa-apt knows that e.g. NOAA 19 uses 137.1MHz or close). Should have 9
#   consecutive digits, e.g: 137100000.
# - %1, %2, %3, ..., %9: Ignore 1, 2, 3, ... 9 characters. Useful if the
#   filename has something not useful that can change, for example pass elevation.
